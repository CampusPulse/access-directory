                    <p>CampusPulse Access is an interactive map and catalog of accessibility infrastructure on RIT's campus organized by crowdsourced maintenance status. This project aims to make it easier for campus community members to find and report broken ‘access points’ (elevators, wheelchair lifts, and automatic door openers) in a way that allows others to find out which devices are out of service before the breakage impacts them too. Our primary goals include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Increasing visibility of broken accessibility infrastructure, helping students navigate campus efficiently and reducing duplicate FMS reports</li>
                                <li>Simplifying the reporting process for access points, enabling students to report issues they encounter</li>
                                <!-- <li>These could use some edits.</li> -->
                                <li>Analyzing maintenance data to identify patterns</li>
                            </ul>

                            CampusPulse Access was dreamt by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariafweir/">Maria Weir</a> as a Sociology/Anthropology capstone under the Humanities, Computing, & Design program. This site was developed by <a href="https://www.adriancedwards.com/">Adrian Edwards</a> as part of his larger CampusPulse project with the help of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-laferriere-1ab1b3230/">Daniel Laferriere</a> and based on work by the <a href="https://tunnelvision.csh.rit.edu/about">TunnelVision team.</a></p>
